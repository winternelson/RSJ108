Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Know your audience</h3>
              <p>One of the most important things to remember when writing a lead is to know your audience. You can write an amazing lead, but if it doesn’t attract the attention of your target audience, it's next to useless. That's why it is best to keep in mind keywords that will attract the attention of the people you want. </p>

              <h3>Identify the Five Ws and H</h3>
              <p>To write a good lead, it's best to incorporate your Five Ws and H. This means you should include the what of the story, the why, the when, the where, the who, and how. Of course, using all of these might be too much, but it's best to use the main facts to attract people to your story. </p>

              <h3>Become familiar with the types of leads you can use.</h3>
              <p>Next you need to know the parameters in which you can write your lead. Different types of leads have different purposes. Four common leads include: Name Recognition, Interesting Action Lead, Event Lead, and Second-Day Leads. The Name Recognition Lead utilizes the attention that a famous person can bring to a story by placing the name at the very front of the lead. An Interesting Action Lead does the opposite. It prioritizes what a person did over the person themself. This is great if the person isn’t that well known. Event leads focus on describing the event itself, rather than the people involved. Lastly, Second Day Leads center around new information for the audience to be drawn to.</p>

              <h3>Avoid using problematic leads</h3>
              <p>There are many leads that are overused and should be avoided. This includes leads that use the word “you.” These types of leads are too opinionated. It's also best to stray from question leads, as they assume that the audience would answer in the same type of way. Quote leads are also best unused, but it is okay to start with an anecdote that later leads to a quote. Lastly, don’t use “imagine” leads due to the fact that they are simply cliche and are overused.</p>

              <p>Once you’ve written your lead, you're not finished yet! Make sure that it isn’t too word heavy. It’s also best to see how it flows with the rest of your article. Remember, this is the very first thing your reader is going to be seeing. Make sure it's something that hooks them into reading more!</p>
